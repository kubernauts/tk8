# TK8: A multi-cloud, multi-cluster Kubernetes platform installation and integration tool based on Kubespray!

TK8 is a CLI written in Golang to deploy the upstream Vanilla Kubernetes fully automated based on [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray) on any environment. **We'll provide kubeadm support as soon kubeadm HA support is available through Kubespray project.**

With TK8 you can also install additional add-ons such as a Jmeter Cluster for load testing, Prometheus for monitoring, Jaeger, Linkerd or Zippkin for tracing, Ambassador API Gateway with Envoy for ingress and load balancing, Istio for service mesh support , Jenkins-X for CI/CD and Helm or Kedge for packaging on Kubernetes.

This release supports the Kubernetes installation on AWS and OpenStack / Bare-Metal with HA capabilities.

N.B: MS Azure and GCP support will be added in the very near future.
